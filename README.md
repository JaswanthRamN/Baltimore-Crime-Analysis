# Baltimore-Crime-Analysis
## Project Overview  

This project focuses on **Crime Data Analysis and Visualization** using **Python, Pandas, and Plotly**. The dataset used in this analysis is **"Baltimore911.csv"**, which contains emergency call records for crime incidents.

### Key Steps in the Analysis:
- **Loaded the dataset** and explored its structure (head, info, and statistical summary).
- **Data Profiling & Attribute Analysis**:
  - Identified **data types, unique values, and missing percentages** for each column.
  - Differentiated between **numeric, categorical, and temporal attributes**.
- **Crime Trend Analysis**:
  - **Yearly Trends**: Analyzed crime counts by year and plotted time-series trends.
  - **Monthly Trends**: Visualized crime distribution across different months for multiple years.
  - **Day of Week Trends**: Investigated how crime frequency varies by the day of the week.
- **Interactive Visualizations**:
  - Used **Plotly** to generate **bar charts, line plots, and stacked bar plots**.
  - Added annotations for **better interpretation of trends**.

This project provides insights into **crime patterns and trends**, allowing for better decision-making in **public safety and emergency response planning**.
